## 2) Data Preprocessing  using  Deffirent tools NLP:
   - tokenisation :
   the principle consists of segmenting the text into sentences or words. The text segments are called "tokens". This approach also eliminates characters such as punctuation or emojis.
   - stemming
     Removing prefixes and suffixes involves cutting the end or the beginning of words. The difficulty of this approach lies in determining the right pieces to cut, which requires referring to rules.
   - lemmatization
     Similarly to stemming, the idea is to reduce a word to its base form, or in other words, to its root.
     - Stop words removal
##3)The learning phase based on Deep Learning:
   The objective of the training phase is to predict the entity to which a text message belongs so that the Chatbot responds correctly.
      - Model evaluation and training.
      - MLP architecture tuning.
      - Testing and validation.

 ## 4) Model deployment
